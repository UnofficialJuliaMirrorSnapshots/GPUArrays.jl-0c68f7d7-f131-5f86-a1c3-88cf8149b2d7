#       instead of using `ArrayStyle{GPUArray}`, due to the fact how `similar` works.

# - `bc::Broadcast.Broadcasted{Style}`
# - `ex::Broadcast.Extruded`
# - `LinearAlgebra.Transpose{,<:GPUArray}` and `LinearAlgebra.Adjoint{,<:GPUArray}`, etc
#    as arguments to a kernel and that they do the right conversion.
#
# This Broadcast can be further customize by:
# - `Broadcast.preprocess(dest::GPUArray, bc::Broadcasted{Nothing})` which allows for a
#   complete transformation based on the output type just at the end of the pipeline.
# - `Broadcast.broadcasted(::Style, f)` selection of an implementation of `f` compatible
#   with `Style`
#
# For more information see the Base documentation.
